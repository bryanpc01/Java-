 * File: GradeCalculatorBryan.java
 * Author: Java, Java, Java
 * Description: Instances of this class are used to calculate
 *  a course average and a letter grade. In order to calculate
 *  the average and the letter grade, a GradeCalculator must store
 *  two essential pieces of data: the number of grades and the sum
 *  of the grades.  Therefore these are declared as instance variable.
 *  Each time calcAverage(grade) is called, a new grade is added to
 *  the running total, and the number of grades is incremented.
 */

/*
 *  1) Change the program so that it outputs +/- letter grades (you can decide
 *     the thresholds )
 *
 *  2) Output, in addition to the average and letter grade, the number of grades
 *     entered so far. This requires a new method in the GradeCalculator class:
 *       public int getCount()
 *
 *  3) Modify the addGrade() method in the GradeCalculator class so that it will
 *     reject grades that are out of range... and do not update the grade count if
 *     there is a problem with the grade range.
 *     a) notify the user that the grade has been rejected, but keep the program
 *        running
 *
 *  4) Check user input for errors. The program should handle the entry of characters,
 *     and other non-numeric symbols without causing a crash
